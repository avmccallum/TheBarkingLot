This app is for a volunteer-run pet fostering company called The Barking Lot. It provides information to the user about the needs of various types of pets and allows a simple, centralized search for local resources such as animal hospitals, pet supplies, and boarding services.

### Getting Started

#### Home
The app launches to the home screen, which displays a brief introduction to the company, and various bits of information that the user can swipe through. This includes links to fostering/adoption information, a link to donate if desired, and the date of the newest upcoming adoption event. The home screen also has links to their social media accounts.

#### Pet Quiz
The pet quiz screen opens to a brief description of the quiz and a disclaimer that the results are just a recommendation. The user can navigate to begin the quiz from this page. Once all seven questions are complete, they can submit it to receive their results. 

Possible options are kitten, adult cat, elderly cat, puppy, adult dog, elderly dog, misc. pet (generally rodents, reptiles, and fish for the purposes of this app), no match, and the additional expert result that is triggered by answering that they have a lot of experience caring for animals.

Each result displays an image and a description of the pet's needs which corresponds with the questions asked in the quiz.

#### Resources
The resources screen contains a link to a screen containing all of the possible animal-specific results of the quiz (that is, not including the 'no match' or 'expert' results), as well as several other links. The animal information screen allows users to view all possible results so they can decide for themselves if they think they are capable of caring for a specific animal or not regardless of quiz result. 

The other links on the screen direct the user to a map query for local resources including: emergency animal hospitals, veterinary clinics, pet supplies, grooming services, and boarding services. These links all open externally.

#### Contact
The contact screen displays the phone number, email address, and street address of The Barking Lot. There are also buttons included so the user can easily call, email, or view their location on a map. There is also a screen for them to fill and sumbit a form applying to be a foster family. The form asks for their name, email, phone number, previous experience, and type of pet they would prefer, and submits to an email message they can send.

#### Settings
The settings screen is accessed via the gear in the corner of the screen.
