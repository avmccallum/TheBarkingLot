    <!-- Kittens -->
    <string name="kitten">Kittens</string>
    <string name="kitten_hours">Kittens shouldn\'t be left unsupervised for long periods of time.
        They can get into all kinds of trouble and they can get into all kinds of small places.</string>
    <string name="kitten_activity">They don\'t need a lot of strenuous activity, like walking or
        playing, but they can be a lot to keep up with and a close eye should be kept on them.</string>
    <string name="kitten_experience">Taking care of a kitten is more work than that of an adult cat,
        but if they\'re healthy and well tempered taking care of them shouldn\'t be very demanding.
        There\'s always lots of resources to help new owners too.</string>
    <string name="kitten_enclosure">Cats generally don\'t need dedicated cages, but kittens need to
        have somewhere they can be kept while you\'re away or sleeping. Keeping them in one room
        usually works just fine, like a bathroom where they can\'t get in to a lot of trouble,
        or a single bedroom with the door closed.</string>
    <string name="kitten_outdoor">It\'s dangerous for cats to be let outdoors, and doubly so for kittens. Unless you\'re
        keeping them on a leash, they should be indoors.</string>
    <string name="kitten_companion">Kittens are more active and playful when they\'re younger, and
        tend to mellow out with age.</string>
    <string name="kitten_grooming">Kittens very rarely need to be bathed but after 3 months old,
        brushing should be a regular occurrence. As they get older they\'ll need the occasional
        teeth cleaning and nail trimming.</string>
    <!-- Adult cats -->
    <string name="cat_adult">Adult Cats</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_hours">Unless your cat is particularly aloof, you should be spending
        some time with them, but you probably don\'t need to go out of your way to set aside the time.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_activity">Fully grown cats tend to be very low maintenance. They might
        be willing to play for a little, but they can usually keep themselves entertained.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_experience">An adult cat is usually a very low maintenance pet and
        there\'s a lot of resources for beginners.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_enclosure">Adult cats don\'t need a dedicated enclosure. They might get
        in to some trouble, but that just comes with having a pet.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_outdoor">It\'s dangerous for cats to be let outdoors. Unless you\'re
        keeping them on a leash, they should be indoors.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_companion">Some cats are very aloof and some are very cuddly. It\'s
        important to ask about their temperament or spend some time getting to know them before you
        make a decision to bring them home.</string>
    <string name="cat_adult_grooming">It\'s very rare to need to bathe a cat. Usually all they
        need is regular brushing, nail trimming, and the occasional tooth cleaning.</string>
    <!-- Elderly cats -->
    <string name="cat_elderly">Elderly Cats</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_hours">An elderly cat is probably going to be very low energy.
        If you pay attention to them when they ask, they\'ll probably be happy.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_activity">An elderly cat isn\'t going to need hardly any regular
        activity. Maybe get a laser pointer and see if they feel like chasing it.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_experience">Cats are overall a fairly easy pet for beginners,
        but as they age more attention needs to be paid to their health. Joints, teeth, diet and
        other factors can all impact how much work they are going to be as they age.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_enclosure">Elderly cats don\'t need dedicated enclosures. They\'re generally
        more low-energy and won\'t get into as much trouble.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_outdoor">It\'s dangerous for cats to be let outdoors. Unless you\'re
        keeping them on a leash, they should be indoors.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_companion">Some cats are very aloof and some are very cuddly. It\'s
        important to ask about their temperament or spend some time getting to know them before you
        make a decision to bring them home.</string>
    <string name="cat_elderly_grooming">It\'s very rare to need to bathe a cat. Usually all they
        need is regular brushing, nail trimming, and the occasional tooth cleaning.</string>

    <string name="puppy_enclosure"></string>
    <string name="puppy_outdoor"></string>
    <string name="puppy_companion"></string>
    <string name="puppy_grooming">Dogs need regular grooming and this is probably going to be even
        more true for a rowdy puppy. Bathing, brushing, teeth cleaning, etc.</string>
    <!-- Adult dog -->
    <string name="dog_adult">Adult Dogs</string>

    <string name="dog_adult_outdoor"></string>
    <string name="dog_adult_companion"></string>
    <string name="dog_adult_grooming">Dogs need regular bathing and let\'s be real, you\'re probably
        going to get water everywhere while you do it. Don\'t forget trying to clip their nails and brush their teeth.</string>
    <!-- Elderly dog -->
    <string name="dog_elderly">Elderly Dogs</string>
    <string name="dog_elderly_hours"></string>
    <string name="dog_elderly_activity"></string>

    <string name="dog_elderly_outdoor"></string>
    <string name="dog_elderly_companion"></string>
    <string name="dog_elderly_grooming">Elderly dogs might not make as much of a mess in the bathtub,
        but they still need regular grooming. Bathing, nail clipping, tooth brushing, the whole works.</string>
    <!-- Misc pets -->
    <string name="misc_pets">Other Pets</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_hours">Most other pets such as rodents, reptiles, and fish require
        little dedicated attention. If you are caring for them right, they can usually be left alone
        for most of the day.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_activity">If you set up their enclosure right, you\'re not going to need
        to do a lot to make sure they\'re active and entertained. Hamster wheels exist for a reason,
        and it\'s so you don\'t have to try and walk them.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_experience">Reptiles, fish, some rodents, and other animals usually have
        pretty specific requirements for their care. Sometimes it\'s not easy to determine
        what\'s good advice and what\'s not, so it wouldn\'t hurt to have more pet experience under your belt.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_enclosure">Most of these pets will require some kind of enclosure. If
        you\'re looking to take care of them right, you should make sure it\'s the appropriate size.
        It\'s their home, would it be fair if it was just a small, cramped box? This means sometimes
        the enclosures can get pretty big depending on the animal and how many you\'re planning to have.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_outdoor">Have you ever seen someone take a lizard for a walk? You can
        if you want but you almost definitely won\'t need to.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_companion">Generally these pets will keep to themselves. Some might
        require a companion to keep them company, such as guinea pigs, but they generally won\'t be
        all that interested in you. That doesn\'t mean you can\'t still hangout with them though.</string>
    <string name="misc_pet_grooming">Most of these pets won\'t require dedicated grooming. Bathing
        and brushing will be pretty much a non-issue. Make sure to keep their enclosure clean though.</string>
    <!-- Expert pet -->
    <string name="expert_pet">You said you\'re a pro so…</string>
    <string name="expert_desc">Fosters and adoption agencies are always looking for experienced
        people to help with more challenging pets. It can be hard to find people prepared to take in
        ill pets that need specific care, or folks with the experience to help rehabilitate abused
        or feral animals. Talk to one of our volunteers to see who we have that needs help.</string>
